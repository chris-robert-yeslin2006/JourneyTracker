## 📚 Project Overview

**JourneyTracker** is your companion app for keeping track of anime episodes without needing the internet.  
It’s designed with **simplicity**, **speed**, and **your watchlist** in mind.

Key differences from AnimeTrackerExpo:
- Built using **Shift** instead of Expo
- Optimized for native-like performance with minimal JS overhead
- Same useful features — with a new tech foundation!

## ⚙️ Features

- ➕ Add anime to your watchlist
- 🔁 Track and update your current episode
- 📆 Weekly auto-increment for ongoing series
- 💾 Uses device-local storage — works offline
- 🚫 No APIs, no signups, no cloud

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- [Shift (by Infinite Red)](https://shift.infinite.red/)
- [React Native (under the hood)](https://reactnative.dev/)
- Local device storage (AsyncStorage or equivalent)

## 📦 Getting Started

Clone and run locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/chris-robert-yeslin2006/JourneyTracker.git

# 2. Move into the directory
cd JourneyTracker

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Run the app using Shift
npx shift start
💡 Make sure Shift CLI is installed globally if needed.

📌 Motivation
This app was built for personal use — I often forget what episode I last watched. Instead of depending on online trackers, I created a local-first, no-distraction anime tracker that just works.

🛑 Contributions
